# FreeBSD KDE Installer Dialogs

Copyright (C) 2025 - 2026 The [The FreeBSD Foundation](https://freebsdfoundation.org/).


Introduction
------------

This is a WIP script to install KDE Plasma via bsdinstall:
<https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/25>,
for The FreeBSD Foundation's Laptop Support and Usability Project
<https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop>.

The main repository for this project is on
[gitlab/kde-installer-dialogs](https://gitlab.com/alfix/kde-installer-dialogs).
A temporary [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/alfonsosiciliano/kde-installer-dialogs)
is also available to make it easier for participants in the Call for Testing who do not have a GitLab account.

I can also make it slightly snappier if you want it to read more smoothly in documentation. Do you want me to do that?


Call for testing
----------------

A Call for Testing is available. Please read [cft.md](cft.md) it you wanto to participate.
Note, this feature is still experimental, participate only if you are familiar with configuring and using FreeBSD.
